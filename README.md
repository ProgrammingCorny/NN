# My own programmed neuronal network

I have programmed my own neuronal network, without framework like tensorflow or others, only numpy. Under the folder "main" you can find two files: "nn.py" and "mnist_dataset.py". "nn.py" is the basic framework and "mnist_dataset.py" is an example, a practical application. My example "mnist_dataset.py" uses the dataset MNIST, handwritten numbers from 0-9. However, in my fully connected layers, CNN I will program later, I only classify numbers from 0-2. You can find the link for downloading the MNIST dataset under the folder "dataset" in the file "download_dataset.txt".

If you understand how my code works in general, you can look at the output of "mnist_dataset.py" in the "out.txt" file in the folder "main".
